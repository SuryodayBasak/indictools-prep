# indictools-prep
Preprocessing add on for indictools repo

This is a continuation of my TextForegroundExtraction repo, which I'll no longer maintain (because at the moment that I'm typing this, I know that I'm not too fmiliar with git, and ended up corrupting the local repo of TextForegroundExtraction on my computer :P)

This is an add-on for the indictools' repo, which works with Indian manuscripts, annotates and organizes data on the manuscripts.

This repo contains code that will aid in the preprocessing of the images, for further computation.
